# Rivas

Rivas is a terminal Markdown viewer focused on rendering rich Markdown content
directly in Kitty-compatible terminals. It parses Markdown, renders terminal
text with iocraft, and displays image-backed content through the Kitty graphics
protocol.

## Features

- Headings, paragraphs, block quotes, thematic breaks, and wrapped text.
- Inline emphasis, strong text, strikethrough, inline code, links, and inline math.
- Ordered, unordered, nested, and task lists.
- Tables with Markdown alignment markers.
- Local raster images.
- Mermaid diagrams rendered to PNG.
- LaTeX-style math rendered through MiTeX and Typst.
- Vim-style source editing with a side-by-side live preview.
- Vim-style keyboard navigation in the rendered viewer.

## Requirements

Rivas requires a terminal that supports the Kitty graphics protocol, such as:

- Kitty
- WezTerm
- Ghostty

If the terminal does not support the protocol, Rivas exits with an error instead
of falling back to a degraded image mode.

## 🚀 Installation and Usage

### 🪟 Windows

1. Download the `rivas-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` from the Assets in releases.
2. Extract the `.exe` file to a folder of your choice.
3. (Optional) Add the folder to your **System PATH** to run `rivas` from any terminal.

Note: Only works with nightly WezTerm on windows (since other versions do not have full kitty support).

### 🍎 macOS

**Via Binary:**

1. Download `rivas-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` from assets in releases.
2. Extract the file: `rivas-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`.
3. Move it to your bin folder: `sudo mv rivas /usr/local/bin/`.
4. **Note:** If macOS blocks the app, go to *System Settings > Privacy & Security* and click "Allow Anyway."

### 🐧 Linux

```bash
# Download the binary
curl -LO https://github.com/hessikaveh/rivas/releases/download/v0.2.2/rivas-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz

# Extract and install
tar -xzf rivas-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
sudo install -m 755 rivas /usr/local/bin/rivas
```

Then simply run:

```sh
rivas examples/all-rendering-cases.md
```

## Editing

Rivas supports edit in place with neovim style editting and key shortcuts.

## Supported Markdown Notes

Math can be written inline with dollar delimiters:

```md
The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.
```

Display math can use `$$` blocks or fenced `math` blocks:

````md
$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x} \, dx = 1
$$

```math
\Delta(Rivas) = \delta(rivas) \times \frac{2}{2}
```
````

Mermaid diagrams use fenced `mermaid` blocks:

````md
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A --> B --> C
```
````

Local images are resolved relative to the Markdown file:

```md
![Seedling](./seedling.png)
```

## Development

Run the test suite:

```sh
cargo test
```

The math tests compile LaTeX-like input through TyLax and Typst, rasterize the
resulting SVG to PNG, and verify that rendered output is not an all-white page.
